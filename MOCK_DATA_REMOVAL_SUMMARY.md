# Mock Data Removal Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed all mock data from the PSP Platform application and replaced it with proper API calls and state management.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard.tsx (`frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)
**Removed:**
- Mock `stats` object (volume, approvals, declines, pendingReviews, availableBalance, pendingBalance)
- Mock `alerts` array (warning and info alerts)
- Mock `recentTransactions` array (3 sample transactions)

**Added:**
- TypeScript interfaces for `DashboardStats`, `Alert`, and `RecentTransaction`
- State management with `useState` for stats, alerts, and recentTransactions
- `useEffect` hook to fetch dashboard data on mount and when `dateRange` changes
- Loading state with spinner UI
- Empty state handling for transactions with call-to-action button
- TODO comments indicating where actual API endpoints need to be implemented

### 2. PaymentRequests.tsx (`frontend/src/pages/PaymentRequests.tsx`)
**Removed:**
- Mock `paymentRequests` array (3 sample payment requests with customer data)

**Added:**
- TypeScript interface for `PaymentRequest`
- State management with `useState` for paymentRequests
- `useEffect` hook to fetch payment requests from `/api/payment-requests`
- Client-side filtering for search and status filters (`filteredRequests`)
- Loading state with spinner UI
- Empty state handling with different messages for "no data" vs "no filtered results"
- Error handling for failed API calls

### 3. Transactions.tsx (`frontend/src/pages/Transactions.tsx`)
**Removed:**
- Mock `transactions` array (3 sample transactions with full transaction details)

**Added:**
- TypeScript interface for `Transaction`
- State management with `useState` for transactions
- `useEffect` hook to fetch transactions from `/api/transactions`
- Client-side filtering for search, status, and payment method (`filteredTransactions`)
- Loading state with spinner UI
- Empty state handling with informative messages
- Disabled export button when no transactions exist
- Error handling for failed API calls

## Additional Improvements

### User Experience Enhancements
1. **Loading States**: All pages now show a loading spinner while fetching data
2. **Empty States**: Helpful messages and call-to-action buttons when no data exists
3. **Filter Feedback**: Dynamic descriptions showing filtered vs total counts
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with console logging

### Type Safety
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Removed inline type definitions in favor of explicit interfaces

### Code Quality
- No linting errors introduced
- Consistent code structure across all pages
- Proper dependency arrays in `useEffect` hooks

## API Endpoints Required

The following API endpoints need to be implemented in the backend:

### Dashboard
- `GET /api/dashboard/stats?range={dateRange}` - Dashboard statistics
- `GET /api/dashboard/alerts` - System alerts
- `GET /api/dashboard/recent-transactions` - Recent transactions list

### Payment Requests
- `GET /api/payment-requests` - List all payment requests (already exists)

### Transactions
- `GET /api/transactions` - List all transactions

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test loading states by simulating slow API responses
2. Test empty states by checking the UI when no data exists
3. Test error states by simulating API failures
4. Test filter functionality with various data sets
5. Verify that all pages handle authentication errors properly

## Next Steps

1. Implement the missing backend API endpoints listed above
2. Add pagination support for large data sets
3. Consider adding refresh buttons to manually reload data
4. Add proper error UI (instead of just console logging)
5. Implement proper toast notifications for errors
6. Add data caching to reduce unnecessary API calls
